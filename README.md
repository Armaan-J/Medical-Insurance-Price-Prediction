# Medical-Insurance-Price-Prediction
##ML Linear Regression Model for Medical Insurance Cost Prediction
This Python project is focused on predicting medical insurance costs using a machine learning linear regression model. The project utilizes popular data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn (sklearn). The objective of this project is to build a linear regression model that predicts the medical insurance cost of an individual based on their age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region.

The dataset used in this project consists of medical insurance data, including the age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region, and insurance charges. The dataset contains information on various individuals and their medical insurance costs. The data has been collected from various regions in the United States.

Scikit-learn: for building and evaluating machine learning models
Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

Data Cleaning: This section includes data cleaning and preprocessing steps such as removing missing values, handling outliers, and converting data types.
Data Analysis: This section includes analyzing medical insurance cost trends and preparing the data for training the linear regression model.
Model Training: This section includes training the linear regression model using the cleaned and prepared data.
Model Evaluation: This section includes evaluating the performance of the trained model using various metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Data Visualization: This section includes creating various plots and charts to better understand the data and visualize the results of the linear regression model.
Conclusion
This project provides an opportunity to analyze medical insurance cost trends and build a linear regression model that predicts the medical insurance cost of an individual based on their age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region. By using popular data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn, we can effectively analyze and visualize the data, train the linear regression model, and evaluate its performance. The project results can be used to optimize insurance pricing strategies and improve the overall healthcare system.
